## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with Image Detection / Locating

- If buttons are not detected properly, replace the images with new screenshots of the buttons.  
  Make sure the new images have the **exact same filenames**.

- If textboxes or other elements are in the wrong position, update their **coordinates** according to your display resolution.

## üìù Notes

- Works best with consistent screen resolution.  
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed (e.g., `pyautogui`, `colorama`).
